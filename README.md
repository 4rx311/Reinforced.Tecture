# What is that?

This is experimental architectural framework for .NET applications. It is based on CQRS and functional programming approaches. Tecture intensively utilizes C# features, strong typization, lambda expressions, extension methods and generics. Usage experience is very similar to LINQ. The most close project that does somewhat similar is [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR), but Tecture is more wide and covers more problems. 

Reinforced.Tecture [is available on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Reinforced.Tecture/).

```bash
> Install-Package Reinforced.Tecture
```

Documentation is in progress.
